Process Document Outline: Configuration of VLANs on Network Switches

1. Approval Table:
   - Include a table listing stakeholders and their roles in approving the SOP. This may include network administrators, IT managers, security officers, etc. 
   - Columns should include roles, names, and signatures.
   - Ensure that appropriate sign-offs are obtained before finalizing the SOP.

2. Purpose:
   - Clearly state the purpose of the SOP, emphasizing the need for proper VLAN configuration to optimize network performance and enhance security.
   - Explain how adhering to this procedure will help maintain consistency and efficiency in VLAN configuration across the network infrastructure.

3. Scope and Objectives:
   - Define the scope of the SOP, specifying which network switches and VLAN configurations are covered.
   - Outline the objectives of proper VLAN configuration, such as segmenting network traffic, improving performance, enhancing security, and facilitating network management.

4. Accountability Matrix:
   - Create a matrix outlining the responsibilities of different roles involved in VLAN configuration, such as network engineers, administrators, and technicians.
   - Clearly define who is accountable for each step of the process, from planning to implementation and documentation.

5. Detailed Steps:
   - Provide a step-by-step guide for configuring VLANs on network switches, including both command-line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) methods if applicable.
   - Include detailed instructions for tasks such as creating VLANs, assigning VLAN membership, configuring trunk ports, and implementing VLAN routing.
   - Include screenshots or command examples to illustrate key steps and configurations.

6. Revision History:
   - Maintain a record of revisions made to the SOP, including the date of revision, the person responsible for the change, a brief description of the modification, and the reason for the revision.
